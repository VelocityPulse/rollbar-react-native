[Rollbar](https://rollbar.com) is a real-time exception reporting service for React-Native and other languages. The Rollbar service will
alert you of problems with your code and help you understand them in a ways never possible before. We love it and we hope you will too.

Rollbar-react-native is the SDK for React Native apps and includes support for Android, iOS, and Javascript.

## Key benefits of using Rollbar React Native are:
